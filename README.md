This repository contains the slideshow editor created for Dr. Delugach's Senior Design course in Spring 2021.

The "SlideshowMaker" folder contains two applications: a slideshow editor and a slideshow player, both written in Java. The slideshow editor allows users to select image files from a directory
and arrange them in the desired order. The user can also apply transitions, a soundtrack, and automatic timing to their presentation if they wish before exporting a file containing
information about the layout of their desired slideshow. 

The slideshow player reads the previously mentioned layout file and uses it to construct and present the slideshow described within. The playback controls present within the program vary based
on if automatic or manual playback was selected during the creation process.
