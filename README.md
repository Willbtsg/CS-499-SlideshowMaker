This repository contains the slideshow editor created for Dr. Delugach's Senior Design course in Spring 2021.

This project is still in it's early planning stages, and the code included here is sample code given to us by the professor.

When the project is complete, it will contain a slideshow editor written in Java. It will present images as thumbnails which the user can then move to another section of the GUI and
arrange however they wish. The user will be able to apply transitions, a soundtrack, and automatic timing to their presentation if they wish before exporting a file containing
information about the layout of their desired slideshow. 

There will be another application (also written in Java) that reads the previously mentioned layout file and uses it to construct and present the slideshow described within.
